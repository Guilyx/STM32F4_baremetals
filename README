# HV-STM32 Baremetals

All projects here are tested on a Virtual Prototype I'm developing at [Hiventive](https://www.hiventive.com/). Most of them are tested on a real hardware ( STM32F4Discovery Board ),
but some aren't.
Some functionalities aren't implemented yet on the prototype and therefore some codes aren't optimal i.e. the overabuse of polling instead of interrupts.
